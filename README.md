# tollgatebuilder #

`tollgatebuilder` is a script that will create you a Debian installation with tollgate installed and configured inside of it.  More information about tollgate is available at http://tollgate.org.au/

The purpose of this is to help automate the creation of tollgate machines / environments.

This is more or less the "official" installation documentation.

These scripts are available under the same licensing terms as tollgate itself.
